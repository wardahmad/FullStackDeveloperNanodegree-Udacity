# FSND: Capstone Project

## Motivation for project
This is the last project of `Udacity-Full-Stack-Nanodegree` Course.
and It covers following technical topics in 1 app:
1. Database modeling with `postgres` & `sqlalchemy`
2. API to performance CRUD Operations on database with `Flask`

```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* edit a few informations in `config.py`, so it can
correctly connect to a local database
* Change `os.environ['DATABASE_URL']` to your local database
* If you want to test the execute tests, Run `python test_app.py`
* If you want to test the API by `postman`, you can take the existing tokens in `test_app.py`
* If you want to Run the development server `$ python app.py`

## Authentification

All API Endpoints are decorated with Auth0 permissions. To use the project locally, you need to config Auth0 accordingly

### Auth0 for locally use
#### Create an App & API

1. Login to https://manage.auth0.com/ 
2. Click on Applications Tab
3. Create Application
4. Give it a name and select "Regular Web Application"
5. Go to Settings and find `domain`. Copy & paste it into models.py
6. Click on API Tab 
7. Create a new API:
8. Go to Settings and find `Identifier`. Copy & paste it into auth.py

#### Create Roles & Permissions
1. Before creating 'Roles & Permissions', you need to 'Enable RBAC' in your API 
2. check the button 'Add Permissions in the Access Token'.
3. create a new Role under 'Users and Roles' => 'Roles' => 'Create Roles'
4. Go back to the API Tab and find your newly created API. Click on Permissions.
5. Create & assign all needed permissions 
6. After you created all permissions , go back to 'Users and Roles' => 'Roles' and select the role.
7. Under 'Permissions', assign all permissions you want this role to have.
